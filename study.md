# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
The model handles data requests from the controller and returns the data to the controller. 
```

## Define Controller Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
The controller takes the data from the model and puts it in the view. You only manipulate data in the controllers.
```

## Define Router Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
When a web browser makes a request, a router component checks the router file to chose which controller it will use to handle the request based on the web request and HTTP protocol.

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
A get request starts at the web browser and a router will check a router file to determine which controller it should use to handle the get request. The controller will then get the requested data from a model, then the controller will return a response with JSon data from the model with a view component that displays the data in an HTML file that is assembled by controller.
